> ## Prerequisites
>
> This lesson guides you through the basics of using a computer cluster (or batch farm or supercomputer). If you have already written small programs with a language of your choice and know the difference between a “variable” and a “function”, you are ready for this lesson.
>
> If you're already comfortable with using systems like LSF, Slurm or PBS/Pro and have already run parallel applications on a supercomputer, you probably won't learn much from this lesson, but are welcome to help the others as a technical assistant or contribute to this course material.
