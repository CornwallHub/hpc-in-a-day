some motivational text 

> ## Prerequisites
>
> This lesson guides you through the basics of using a computer cluster (or batch farm or supercomputer).  If you have stored files on a computer at all and recognize the word “file” and either “directory” or “folder” (two common words for the same thing), you're ready for this lesson.
>
> If you're already comfortable with using systems like LSF, Slurm or PBS/Pro and have already run parallel applications on a supercomputer, you probably won't learn much from this lesson.
